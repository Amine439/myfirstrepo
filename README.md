My first repository on github

I am desperately trying to learn code although I would rather be doing something else, like listening to music, playing gungeon. I have a quadrillion (two) different responsibilties I should be taking care off, but the junk in my brain does not seem to be plannign on going anywhere, and I really want to be able to focus. What if I planned out my day really quicklt? Mom is right, without the organisational properties of ISAK where I know I will have exactly this much time before I have to check-in, go to the next club, have lunch, have dinner, see friend; I can't function. That in my mind is not the qualities you would want in an IB student, in an ICE leader, in a globe wanderer, or in a succesful entrepreneur. Sprout has to be succeful and I can't power through till I'm there, I'd just be setting myself upfor failure in the long run. Ok, plan the day:
